            Ragging is strictly banned in our college. If anybody is found indulging in such kind of activities, strict action will be taken irrespective of the extent of the act. Ragging is banned by the Supreme Court of India. In order to prevent such kind of activity in campus, an Anti-Ragging Committee has been formed by the Principal.
          </p>
        <p class="px-10 py-10 " style="font-size: 20px;">
         Ragging has ruined countless innocent lives and careers. In order to eradicate it, Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 887 of 2009,passed the judgement wherein guidelines were issued for setting up of a Central Crisis Hotline and Anti-Ragging database A black box has been placed outside the Principal’s office which will remain in the custody of the Principal. Any complaint regarding ragging should be put into this black box with details and without delay. Care should be taken to mention only the absolute truth. The identity of the student who complains will be kept confidential. A report on cases of ragging will be sent to the University every year.
